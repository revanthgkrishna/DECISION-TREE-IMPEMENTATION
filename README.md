#Description:  

The objective of this task is to implement a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes on a chosen dataset. Decision Trees are a fundamental supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. The task involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the data, training a Decision Tree model, visualizing the tree structure, and evaluating its performance. The visualization will help in understanding how the tree splits the data and makes decisions.
Steps :
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn.
5. Visualize the Decision Tree.
6. Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.
